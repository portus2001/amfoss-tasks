# Task-6

# CLI App using Go

## About 

The task is to build a command-line tool that prints the details (count of followers, user handle, etc) of a Twitter user using the flags package in **Go**.You must give the Twitter handle as input to the flag. The output must be written to a text file (learn about file handling in Go).
Resources:
  * **https://tour.golang.org/**  (basic understanding of Go syntax)
  * **https://gobyexample.com/command-line-flags**  (learn about the flags package)

## How I Did

* I applied for a **twitter developer account** to get the Consumer key, Consumer secret, Token key, Token secret, as these were needed to retrieve the information of any twitter user.
* I refered to the following you tube videos to get a basic understanding of the Go language.
