# Task-4

# Advanced XOR

## How did I do it

   * First I went through the encryption script "xor_adv.py" and learnt how encryption is actually working.
   * Learnt about functions like encode(), decode(), urandom().
   * Learnt a lot about the use of importing hashlib, urandom and also about the use of "hex".
   * Tried taking all alphabets and making combinations for plaintext, but later realized that it would take a very long time.
   * So I made a list of several alphabets in such a way that this particular cyphertext can be decoded in a very less time.
   * Was successful after several attempts.
