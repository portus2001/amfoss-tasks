# Mario

## About

Implement a program that prints out a half-pyramid of a specified height.

## How I Did

* User is asked to input the height of the pyramid.

* If the user enters any number which is less than zero, or greater than 23, then the user is again asked to input height using a **do while** loop.

* Using a **for** loop, where a variable is incremented till the height of the pyramid.

* Inside the for loop, another **two for loops** are used where one is used to print space and the other is used to print "#".
